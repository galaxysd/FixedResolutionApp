DISCLAIMER - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
I am not responsible for any damage caused to your computer!!!

Put your desired resolution in the config.cfg file in this format:
Width Height refreshRate

For example:
1680 1050 60

Save and run "Fixed Resolution.exe". 
This app will make sure that your computer will always stays with your chosen resolution and screen frequincy. 
This is useful if you have a crappy kvm with no/corrupted EDID reading.
If the app is any good, put a shortcut in "\Start Menu\Programs\Startup" and just forget about it.

NOTE:
While this app is running, You can't change the resolution manually through windows settings... 
You MUST kill "Fixed Resolution.exe" process from the task manager first.

CAUTION!!
Please be very careful when you write your resolution in the config.cfg !!
This app doesn't check for unsupported resolutions of your screen!
I highly recommend trying it before allowing it to run on startup. That way, if anything goes wrong and you're getting a blank screen,  you can do a hard reset to your pc.
